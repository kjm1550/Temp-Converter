# Temp-Converter
This is a project I did to practice my JavaScript. This web app shows conversions for Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin in real time. As the user types in a number in one of the boxes the other unit boxes will show the converted number. This web app works great on a computer and a phone, being responsive to the window size.
