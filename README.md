# Temp-Converter
This is a project I did to practice my JavaScript. This web app will show conversions for Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin in real time. As the user type in a number in one of the units the other units will be filled in with the converted number. This web app works great on a computer and a phone, being responsive to the window size.
